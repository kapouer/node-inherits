node-inherits
=============

Helper function to do classic inheritance in JavaScript.

node-inherits is an implementation of trivial, obvious code
that is nonetheless required by several Node.js modules.
Those modules use 'inherits', the license of which is not clear
enough to be called a free software license.
This original rewrite allows node-inherits to propose an alternative
with a free software license.

See source code for usage.
